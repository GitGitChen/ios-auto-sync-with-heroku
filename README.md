# AutoSyncWithHeroku

I'm just playing with heroku automatic rest API generation using Core Data Build Pack. I'm testing this out by building a basic sports game score app that will eventually automatically sync. I will eventually try this out with Firebase as the data source rather than Heroku/Postgres, and then Meteor and/or Ember/Firebase for a web-app version. This is all just for fun to learn this stuff.

Eventually it would be cool to hook this up into an actual live score api, but that may never happen because those APIs usually aren't free.

Most of this doesn't work yet.
